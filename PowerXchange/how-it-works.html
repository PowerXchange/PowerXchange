        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>PowerXchange is a peer-to-peer solar energy trading platform that enables the buying and selling of excess renewable energy between homeowners and businesses. Here's how it works:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Install a renewable energy system:</strong> Homeowners and businesses can install renewable energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, to generate their own clean energy.</li>

            <li><strong>Connect to the PowerXchange platform:</strong> Once the renewable energy system is installed, it can be connected to the PowerXchange platform through an energy meter. The meter tracks the amount of energy generated and consumed by the home or business.</li>

            <li><strong>List excess energy for sale:</strong> If the renewable energy system generates more energy than is needed, the excess energy can be listed for sale on the PowerXchange platform. The price for the energy is set by the seller.</li>

            <li><strong>Purchase excess energy:</strong> Buyers can search for available energy listings on the PowerXchange platform and purchase excess energy at the listed price. The energy is transferred to the buyer through the energy meter.</li>

            <li><strong>Payment and settlement:</strong> PowerXchange uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to securely and transparently process payments and settlements between buyers and sellers. The platform charges a commission on each transaction.</li>
